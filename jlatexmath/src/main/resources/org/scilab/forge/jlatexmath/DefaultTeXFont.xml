of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent
module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module.
An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based
on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this exception
to your version of the library, but you are not obliged to do so.
If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your
